You're probably gonna need to do some math. You can do inline equations like $a^2+b^2=c^2$ by wrapping with dollar signs. Especially useful for inline equations is \verb=\nicefrac=, which is a package loaded, and does diagonal fractions instead of vertical. This can keep inline equations looking nice and uncramped. $K.E. = \nicefrac{mv^2}{2}.$ instead of $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.$ You will also want separate equations like \ref{einstein}.

\begin{equation}\label{einstein}
    e=mc^2
\end{equation}

Curly braces are used in \ref{exp} for multi character sub/superscripts. It also shows how to use greek characters. There are a ton of other features for \LaTeX \; equations that you can find with Google.

\begin{equation}\label{exp}
    -1 = e^{i\pi} 
\end{equation}

Referencing equation numbers using \verb=\ref{label}= is handy because it updates the number if the numbering changes \eg you add another equations.

In addition to mathematical equations, you may also want to include chemical (\ref{rxn:methane} or nuclear (\ref{rxn:tritium}) reactions. This template has a custom environment to have a separate counter and present with a different label than mathematical expressions.

\begin{reaction}\label{rxn:methane}
    CH_4 + 2O_2 \to CO_2 + 2H_2O
\end{reaction}

\begin{reaction} \label{rxn:tritium}
    ^{6}Li + n \to {^{3}H} + \alpha
\end{reaction}
