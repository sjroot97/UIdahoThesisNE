\section{Limitations}
Bulleted lists are a good way to present statements when the order doesn't really matter. You also can nest lists if applicable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item first bullet;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item first subbullet;
        \item second subbullet;
    \end{itemize}
    \item second bullet; and
    \item third bullet;
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
Numbered lists are another choice, and are good for sequential discussion.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, put on your socks;
    \item Then, put on your shoes;
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary Remarks}
Inline numbered lists are useful for a couple reasons: 
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item To save space; and \item to improve the flow of reading the list;
\end{enumerate*}
