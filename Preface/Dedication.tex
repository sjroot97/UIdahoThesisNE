{\LARGE\textsc{Dedication}}\vspace{0.5cm}

To my mother, Tammy, who planted and nurtured my love of science. To my father, Paul, who taught me how to design and build, and showed me that I am an engineer. To my cats, Babe and Bunyan, who stayed up with me all those late nights studying and writing. Thank you for your endless support.
