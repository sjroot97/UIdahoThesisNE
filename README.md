# UIdahoThesisNE
This is my version of the UIdaho Thesis Template set up for Engineering. It is heavily based off of Chris Goes' template, which was designed for Computer Science. The most important files are going to be the Template.tex file, where you set up your document, uidahomastersthesis.cls, where you can import new packages and create your custom functions/acronyms/etc, and References.bib, where you place the information for your citations.
